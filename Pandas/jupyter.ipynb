If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Timing\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
